# Sudoku
This project is a simple implementation of a Sudoku solver in C, created as a personal experiment over the holidays. The goal was to refine my understanding of recursion and deepen my skills in C programming.

Features:
Interactive terminal-based interface for input
Recursive backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles
Supports variable Sudoku grid sizes (e.g., 4x4, 9x9)

Technologies:
C programming language
Recursive backtracking algorithm

Notes:
The project was developed as part of my ongoing efforts to improve problem-solving skills and explore different algorithms.
It is currently a work in progress. Though the logic is accurate it can be made more user-friendly. 

Future goals:
To understand how GUI works and make the program more user-friendly. 
Implement a more interactive interface.
